This library provides a set of utility functions and classes to facilitate automated web interactions using Selenium WebDriver. It includes functionalities for waiting for elements, interacting with elements, and performing various actions on web elements. Here are the key components and their functionalities:

WaitUtils Class:
Handles waiting operations in Selenium.
Provides methods to wait for an element to be located (wait_for_element) and to wait for an element to be clickable (wait_for_clickable).
Uses WebDriverWait and ExpectedConditions (EC) to implement these waits.
Element Interaction Methods:
move_to_element: Moves the mouse pointer to a specified web element if it is visible.
find_element: Finds a web element using a specified locator strategy and optionally moves to the element once found.
find_element_by_id: Finds an element by its ID and optionally moves to it.
Form Interaction Methods:
fill_datetime_input: Fills a datetime input field by delegating to fill_date_input.
fill_select_by_text: Selects an option in a dropdown by visible text.
fill_select_by_value: Selects an option in a dropdown by its value.
fill_boolean_select: Selects a boolean option ("Yes" or "No") in a dropdown.
Helper Methods:
select_option_by_text: Selects an option in a dropdown by its visible text, using the Select class from selenium.webdriver.support.ui.

The library follows best practices for Selenium interactions, such as waiting for elements to be present or clickable before interacting with them, and handling exceptions gracefully. It also includes detailed docstrings for methods, explaining their purpose, arguments, and return values.
